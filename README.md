# KingsRaid

Instructions.

1. Download [krng.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cppisking/KingsRaid/master/krng.py) and [nox.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cppisking/KingsRaid/master/nox.py) and put them in the same folder.

2. Install [Python 3.5 or higher](https://www.python.org/).  Just because 2.7 works now, doesn't mean it will in the future!  I plan to break support for Python 2.  Use Python 3.

3. Double click `krng.py` in Windows Explorer.

4. Answer the questions.

5. Profit!

Patches welcome.  Do not use the experimental macros unless you know what you're doing, or maybe you want to help me develop them.  That's just my testbed for new ideas.
